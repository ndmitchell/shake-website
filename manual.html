This document describes how to get started with Shake, assuming no prior Haskell knowledge. First, let's take a look at a Shake build system:</p><pre><code>import Development.Shake
import Development.Shake.Command
import Development.Shake.FilePath
import Development.Shake.Util

main :: IO ()
main = shakeArgs shakeOptions{shakeFiles=&quot;_build/&quot;} $ do
    want [&quot;_build/run&quot; &lt;.&gt; exe]

    phony &quot;clean&quot; $ do
        removeFilesAfter &quot;_build&quot; [&quot;//*&quot;]

    &quot;_build/run&quot; &lt;.&gt; exe *&gt; \out -&gt; do
        cs &lt;- getDirectoryFiles &quot;&quot; [&quot;//*.c&quot;]
        let os = [&quot;_build&quot; &lt;/&gt; c -&lt;.&gt; &quot;o&quot; | c &lt;- cs]
        need os
        cmd &quot;gcc -o&quot; [out] os

    &quot;_build//*.o&quot; *&gt; \out -&gt; do
        let c = dropDirectory1 $ out -&lt;.&gt; &quot;c&quot;
        let m = out -&lt;.&gt; &quot;m&quot;
        () &lt;- cmd &quot;gcc -c&quot; [c] &quot;-o&quot; [out] &quot;-MMD -MF&quot; [m]
        needMakefileDependencies m</code></pre><p>This build system builds the executable <code>_build/run</code> from all C source files in the current directory. It will rebuild if you add/remove any C files to the directory, if the C files themselves change, or if any headers used by the C files change. All generated files are placed in <code>_build</code>, and a <code>clean</code> command is provided that will wipe all the generated files. In the rest of this manual we'll explain how the above code works and how to extend it. </p><h4>Running this example</h4><p>To run the example above:</p><ol><li>Install the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell Platform</a>, which provides a Haskell compiler and standard libraries.</li><li>Type <code>cabal update</code>, to download information about the latest versions of all Haskell packages.</li><li>Type <code>cabal install shake --global --profile</code>, to build and install Shake and all its dependencies.</li><li>Grab a <a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/shake/archive/master.tar.gz">tarball of the repo</a> and move to the <code>docs/manual</code> directory, which includes the code at the beginning as <code>Build.hs</code>, along with some small sample C files.</li><li>In the directory of the example, type <code>runhaskell Build.hs</code>, which should produce an executable <code>_build/run</code>.</li><li>Run <code>_build/run</code> to confirm everything worked.</li></ol><h2>Basic syntax</h2><p>This section explains enough syntax to write a basic Shake build script.</p><h4>Boilerplate</h4><p>The build system above starts with the following boilerplate:</p><pre>
import Development.Shake
import Development.Shake.Command
import Development.Shake.FilePath
import Development.Shake.Util<p>main :: IO ()
main = shakeArgs shakeOptions{shakeFiles=&quot;_build/&quot;} $ do
    <i>build rules</i>
</pre></p><p>All the interesting build-specific code is placed under <tt><i>build rules</i></tt>. Many build systems will be able to reuse that boilerplate unmodified.</p><h4>Defining targets</h4><p>A target is a file we want the build system to produce (typically executable files). For example, if we want to produce the file <code>manual/examples.txt</code> we can write:</p><pre><code>want [&quot;manual/examples.txt&quot;]</code></pre><p>The <code>want</code> function takes a list of strings. In Shake lists are written <code>[item1,item2,item2]</code> and strings are written <code>&quot;contents of a string&quot;</code>. Special characters in strings can be escaped using <code>\</code> (e.g. <code>&quot;\n&quot;</code> for newline) and directory separators are always written <code>/</code>, even on Windows.</p><p>Most files have the same name on all platforms, but executable files on Windows usually have the <code>.exe</code> extension, while on POSIX they have no extension. When writing cross-platform build systems (like the initial example), we can write:</p><pre><code>want [&quot;_build/run&quot; &lt;.&gt; exe]</code></pre><p>The <code>&lt;.&gt;</code> function adds an extension to a file path, and the built-in <code>exe</code> variable evaluates to <code>&quot;exe&quot;</code> on Windows and <code>&quot;&quot;</code> otherwise.</p><h4>Defining rules</h4><p>A rule describes the steps required to build a file. A rule has two components, a <tt><i>pattern</i></tt> and some <tt><i>actions</i></tt>:</p><pre>
<i>pattern</i> *&gt; \out -&gt; do
    <i>actions</i>
</pre><p>The <tt><i>pattern</i></tt> is a string saying which files this rule can build. It may be a specific file (e.g.  <code>&quot;manual/examples.txt&quot; *&gt; ...</code>) or may use wildcards:</p><ul><li>The <code>*</code> wildcard matches anything apart from a directory separator. For example <code>&quot;manual/*.txt&quot;</code> would define a rule for any <code>.txt</code> file in the <code>manual</code> directory, including <code>manual/examples.txt</code>, but would not match <code>manual/examples.zip</code>, <code>examples.txt</code> or <code>manual/docs/examples.txt</code>.</li><li>The <code>//</code> wildcard matches any number of complete path components. For example <code>//*.txt</code> would define a rule for any <code>.txt</code> file, including <code>manual/examples.txt</code>. As another example, <code>manual//examples.txt</code> would match any file named <code>examples.txt</code> inside <code>manual</code>, including both <code>manual/examples.txt</code> and <code>manual/docs/examples.txt</code>.</li></ul><p>It is an error for multiple patterns to match a file being built, so you should keep patterns minimal. Looking at the two rules in the initial example:</p><pre><code>&quot;_build/run&quot; &lt;.&gt; exe *&gt; ...
&quot;_build//*.o&quot; *&gt; ...</code></pre><p>The first matches only the <code>run</code> executable, using <code>&lt;.&gt; exe</code> to ensure the executable is correctly named on all platforms. The second matches any <code>.o</code> file anywhere under <code>_build</code>. As examples, <code>_build/main.o</code> and <code>_build/foo/bar.o</code> both match while <code>main.o</code> and <code>_build/main.txt</code> do not.</p><p>Lots of compilers produce <code>.o</code> files, so if you are combining two different languages, say C and Haskell, use the extension <code>.c.o</code> and <code>.hs.o</code> to avoid overlapping rules.</p><p>The <tt><i>actions</i></tt> are a list of steps to perform and are listed one per line, indented beneath the rule. Actions both express dependencies (say what this rule uses) and run commands (actually generate the file). During the action the <code>out</code> variable is bound to the file that is being produced.</p><h4>A simple rule</h4><p>Let's look at a simple example of a rule:</p><pre><code>&quot;*.rot13&quot; *&gt; \out -&gt; do
    let src = out -&lt;.&gt; &quot;txt&quot;
    need [src]
    cmd &quot;rot13&quot; src &quot;-o&quot; out</code></pre><p>This rule can build any <code>.rot13</code> file. Imagine we are building <code>&quot;file.rot13&quot;</code>, it proceeds by:</p><ul><li>Using <code>let</code> to define a local variable <code>src</code>, using the <code>-&lt;.&gt;</code> extension replacement method, which removes the extension from a file and adds a new extension. When <code>out</code> is <code>&quot;file.rot13&quot;</code> the variable <code>src</code> will become <code>file.txt</code>.</li><li>Using <code>need</code> to introduce a dependency on the <code>src</code> file, ensuring that if <code>src</code> changes then <code>out</code> will be rebuilt and that <code>src</code> will be up-to-date before any further commands are run.</li><li>Using <code>cmd</code> to run the command line <code>rot13 file.txt -o file.rot13</code>, which should read <code>file.txt</code> and write out <code>file.rot13</code> being the ROT13 encoding of the file.</li></ul><p>Many rules follow this pattern - calculate some local variables, <code>need</code> some dependencies, then use <code>cmd</code> to perform some actions. We now discuss each of the three statements.</p><h4>Local variables</h4><p>Local variables can be defined as:</p><pre>
let <i>variable</i> = <i>expression</i>
</pre><p>Where <tt><i>variable</i></tt> is a name consisting of letters, numbers and underscores (a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _). All variables <i>must</i> start with a lower-case letter.</p><p>An <tt><i>expression</i></tt> is any combination of variables and function calls, for example <code>out -&lt;.&gt; &quot;txt&quot;</code>. A list of some common functions is discussed later.</p><p>Variables are evaluated by substituting the <tt><i>expression</i></tt> everywhere the <tt><i>variable</i></tt> is used. In the simple example we could have equivalently written: </p><pre><code>&quot;*.rot13&quot; *&gt; \out -&gt; do
    need [out -&lt;.&gt; &quot;txt&quot;]
    cmd &quot;rot13&quot; (out -&lt;.&gt; &quot;txt&quot;) &quot;-o&quot; out</code></pre><p>Variables are local to the rule they are defined in, cannot be modified, and should not be defined multiple times within a single rule.</p><h4>File dependencies</h4><p>You can express a dependency on a file with:</p><pre><code>need [&quot;file.src&quot;]</code></pre><p>To depend on multiple files you can write:</p><pre><code>need [&quot;file.1&quot;,&quot;file.2&quot;]</code></pre><p>Or alternatively:</p><pre><code>need [&quot;file.1&quot;]
need [&quot;file.2&quot;]</code></pre><p>It is preferable to use fewer calls to <code>need</code>, if possible, as multiple files required by a <code>need</code> can be built in parallel.</p><h4>Running external commands</h4><p>The <code>cmd</code> function allows you to call system commands, e.g. <code>gcc</code>. Taking the initial example, we see: </p><pre><code>cmd &quot;gcc -o&quot; [out] os</code></pre><p>After substituting <code>out</code> (a string variable) and <code>os</code> (a list of strings variable) we might get:</p><pre><code>cmd &quot;gcc -o&quot; [&quot;_make/run&quot;] [&quot;_build/main.o&quot;,&quot;_build/constants.o&quot;]</code></pre><p>The <code>cmd</code> function takes any number of space-separated expressions. Each expression can be either a string (which is treated as a space-separated list of arguments) or a list of strings (which is treated as a direct list of arguments).  Therefore the above command line is equivalent to either of:</p><pre><code>cmd &quot;gcc -o _make/run _build/main.o _build/constants.o&quot;
cmd [&quot;gcc&quot;,&quot;-o&quot;,&quot;_make/run&quot;,&quot;_build/main.o&quot;,&quot;_build/constants.o&quot;]</code></pre><p>To properly handle unknown string variables it is recommended to enclose them in a list, e.g. <code>[out]</code>, so that even if <code>out</code> contains a space it will be treated as a single argument.</p><p>The <code>cmd</code> function as presented here will fail if the system command returns a non-zero exit code, but see later for how to treat failing commands differently.</p><p>As a wart, if the <code>cmd</code> call is <i>not</i> the last line of a rule, you must precede it with <code>() &lt;- cmd ...</code>.</p><h4>Filepath manipulation functions</h4><p>Shake provides a complete library of filepath manipulation functions (see the manual docs for <code>Development.Shake.FilePath</code>), but the most common are:</p><ul><li><code>str1 &lt;/&gt; str2</code> - add the path components together with a slash, e.g. <code>&quot;_build&quot; &lt;/&gt; &quot;main.o&quot;</code> equals <code>&quot;_build/main.o&quot;</code>.</li><li><code>str1 &lt;.&gt; str2</code> - add an extension, e.g. <code>&quot;main&quot; &lt;.&gt; &quot;o&quot;</code> equals <code>&quot;main.o&quot;</code>.</li><li><code>str1 ++ str2</code> - append two strings together, e.g. <code>&quot;hello&quot; ++ &quot;world&quot;</code> equals <code>&quot;helloworld&quot;</code>.</li><li><code>str1 -&lt;.&gt; str2</code> - replace an extension, e.g. <code>&quot;main.c&quot; -&lt;.&gt; &quot;o&quot;</code> equals <code>&quot;main.o&quot;</code>.</li><li><code>dropExtension str</code> - drop the final extension of a filepath if it has one, e.g. <code>dropExtension &quot;main.o&quot;</code> equals <code>&quot;main&quot;</code>, while <code>dropExtension &quot;main&quot;</code> equals <code>&quot;main&quot;</code>.</li><li><code>takeFileName str</code> - drop the path component, e.g. <code>takeFileName &quot;_build/src/main.o&quot;</code> equals <code>&quot;main.o&quot;</code>.</li><li><code>dropDirectory1 str</code> - drop the first path component, e.g. <code>dropDirectory1 &quot;_build/src/main.o&quot;</code> equals <code>&quot;src/main.o&quot;</code>.</li></ul><h2>Advanced Syntax</h2><p>The following section covers more advanced operations that are necessary for moderately complex build systems, but not simple ones.</p><h4>Directory listing dependencies</h4><p>The function <code>getDirectoryFiles</code> can retrieve a list of files within a directory:</p><pre><code>files &lt;- getDirectoryFiles &quot;&quot; [&quot;//*.c&quot;]</code></pre><p>After this operation <code>files</code> will be a variable containing all the files matching the pattern <code>&quot;//*.c&quot;</code> (those with the extension <code>.c</code>) starting at the directory <code>&quot;&quot;</code> (the current directory). To obtain all <code>.c</code> and <code>.cpp</code> files in the src directory we can write:</p><pre><code>files &lt;- getDirectoryFiles &quot;src&quot; [&quot;//*.c&quot;,&quot;//*.cpp&quot;]</code></pre><p>The <code>getDirectoryFiles</code> operation is tracked by the build system, so if the files in a directory changes the rule will rebuild in the next run. You should only use <code>getDirectoryFiles</code> on source files, not files that are generated by the build system, otherwise the results will change while you are running the build and the build may be inconsistent.</p><h4>List manipulations</h4><p>Many functions work with lists of values. The simplest operation on lists is to join two lists together, which we do with <code>++</code>. For example, <code>[&quot;main.c&quot;] ++ [&quot;constants.c&quot;]</code> equals <code>[&quot;main.c&quot;,&quot;constants.c&quot;]</code>.</p><p>Using a <i>list comprehension</i> we can produce new lists, apply functions to the elements and filtering them. As an example:</p><pre><code>[&quot;_build&quot; &lt;/&gt; x -&lt;.&gt; &quot;o&quot; | x &lt;- inputs]</code></pre><p>This expression grabs each element from <code>inputs</code> and names it <code>x</code> (the <code>x &lt;- inputs</code>, pronounced &quot;<code>x</code> is drawn from <code>inputs</code>&quot;), then applies the expression  <code>&quot;_build&quot; &lt;/&gt; x -&lt;.&gt; &quot;o&quot;</code> to each element. If we start with the list <code>[&quot;main.c&quot;,&quot;constants.c&quot;]</code>, we would end up with <code>[&quot;_build/main.o&quot;,&quot;_build/constants.o&quot;]</code>.</p><p>List expressions also allow us to filter the list, for example we could know that the file <code>&quot;evil.c&quot;</code> is in the directory, but should not be compiled. We can extend that to:</p><pre><code>[&quot;_build&quot; &lt;/&gt; x -&lt;.&gt; &quot;o&quot; | x &lt;- inputs, x /= &quot;evil.c&quot;]</code></pre><p>The <code>/=</code> operator checks for inequality, and any predicate after the drawn from is used to first restrict which elements of the list are available.</p><h4>Using <code>gcc</code> to collect headers</h4><p>One common problem when building <code>.c</code> files is tracking down which headers they transitively import, and thus must be added as a dependency. We can solve this problem by asking <code>gcc</code> to create a file while building that contains a list of all the imports. If we run:</p><pre><code>gcc -c main.c -o main.o -MMD -MF main.m</code></pre><p>That will compile <code>main.c</code> to <code>main.o</code>, and also produce a file <code>main.m</code> containing the dependencies. To add these dependencies as dependencies of this rule we can call:</p><pre><code>needMakefileDependencies &quot;main.m&quot;</code></pre><p>Now, if either <code>main.c</code> or any headers transitively imported by <code>main.c</code> change, the file will be rebuilt. In the initial example the complete rule is:</p><pre><code>&quot;_build//*.o&quot; *&gt; \out -&gt; do
    let c = dropDirectory1 $ out -&lt;.&gt; &quot;c&quot;
    let m = out -&lt;.&gt; &quot;m&quot;
    () &lt;- cmd &quot;gcc -c&quot; [c] &quot;-o&quot; [out] &quot;-MMD -MF&quot; [m]
    needMakefileDependencies m</code></pre><p>We first compute the source file <code>c</code> (e.g. <code>&quot;main.c&quot;</code>) that is associated with the <code>out</code> file (e.g. <code>&quot;_build/main.o&quot;</code>). We then compute a temporary file <code>m</code> to write the dependencies to (e.g. <code>&quot;_build/main.m&quot;</code>). We then call <code>gcc</code> using the <code>-MMD -MF</code> flags and then finally call <code>needMakefileDependencies</code>.</p><h4>Top-level variables</h4><p>Variables local to a rule are defined using <code>let</code>, but you can also define top-level variables. Top-level variables are defined before the <code>main</code> call, for example:</p><pre><code>buildDir = &quot;_build&quot;</code></pre><p>You can now use <code>buildDir</code> in place of <code>&quot;_build&quot;</code> throughout. You can also define parametrised variables (functions) by adding argument names:</p><pre><code>buildDir x = &quot;_build&quot; &lt;/&gt; x</code></pre><p>We can now write:</p><pre><code>buildDir (&quot;run&quot; &lt;.&gt; exe) *&gt; \out -&gt; do
    ...</code></pre><p>All top-level variables and functions can be though of as being expanded wherever they are used, although in practice may have their evaluation shared.</p><h4>A clean command</h4><p>A standard clean command is defined as:</p><pre><code>phony &quot;clean&quot; $ do
    removeFilesAfter &quot;_build&quot; [&quot;//*&quot;]</code></pre><p>Running the build system with the <code>clean</code> argument, e.g. <code>runhaskell _build/run clean</code> will remove all files under the <code>_build</code> directory. This clean command is formed from two separate pieces. Firstly, we can define <code>phony</code> commands as:</p><pre>
phony &quot;<i>name</i>&quot; $ do
    <i>actions</i>
</pre><p>Where <tt><i>name</i></tt> is the name used on the command line to invoke the actions, and <tt><i>actions</i></tt> are the list of things to do in response. These names are not dependency tracked and are simply run afresh each time they are requested.</p><p>The <tt><i>actions</i></tt> can be any standard build actions, although for a <code>clean</code> rule, <code>removeFilesAfter</code> is typical. This function waits until after any files have finished building (which will be none, if you do <code>runhaskell _build/run clean</code>) then deletes all files matching <code>//*</code> in the <code>_build</code> directory.</p><h2>Running</h2><p>This section covers how to run the build system you have written.</p><h4>Compiling the build system</h4><p>As shown before, we can use <code>runhaskell _build/run</code> to execute our build system, but doing so causes the build script to be compiled afresh each time. A more common approach is to add a shell script that compiles the build system and runs it. In the example directory you will find <code>build.sh</code> (Linux) and <code>build.bat</code> (Windows), both of which execute the same interesting commands. Looking at <code>build.sh</code>:</p><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
mkdir -p _shake
ghc --make Build.hs -rtsopts -with-rtsopts=-I0 -outputdir=_shake -o _shake/build &amp;&amp; _shake/build &quot;$@&quot;</code></pre><p>This script creates a folder named <code>_shake</code> for the build system objects to live in, then runs <code>ghc --make Build.hs</code> to produce <code>_shake/build</code>, then executes <code>_shake/build</code> with all arguments it was given. The <code>-with-rtsopts</code> flag can be treated as magic - it instructs the Haskell compiler to turn off features that would otherwise steal CPU from the commands you are running.</p><p>Now you can run a build by simply typing <code>./build.sh</code> on Linux, or <code>build</code> on Windows. On Linux you may want to alias <code>build</code> to <code>./build.sh</code>. For the rest of this document we will assume <code>build</code> runs the build system.</p><p><i>Warning:</i> You should not use the <code>-threaded</code> for GHC 7.6 or below because of a <a href="https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/7646">GHC bug</a>. If you do turn on <code>-threaded</code>, you should include <code>-qg -qb</code> in <code>-with-rtsopts</code>. </p><h4>Command line flags</h4><p>The initial example build system supports a number of command line flags, including:</p><ul><li><code>build</code> will compile all files required by <code>want</code>.</li><li><code>build _build/main.o</code> will compile enough to create <code>_build/main.o</code>, ignoring all <code>want</code> requirements.</li><li><code>build clean</code> will delete the contents of <code>_build</code>, because of our <code>phony</code> command.</li><li><code>build --help</code> will list out all flags supported by the build system, currently 36 flags. Most flags supported by <code>make</code> are also supported by Shake based build systems.</li><li><code>build -j8</code> will compile up to 8 rules simultaneously, by default Shake uses 1 processor.</li></ul><p>Most flags can also be set within the program by modifying the <code>shakeOptions</code> value. As an example, <code>build --metadata=_metadata/</code> causes all Shake metadata files to be stored with names such as <code>_metadata/.database</code>. Alternatively we can write <code>shakeOptions{shakeFiles=&quot;_metadata/&quot;}</code> instead of our existing <code>shakeFiles=&quot;_build/&quot;</code>. Values passed on the command line take preference over those given by <code>shakeOptions</code>. Multiple overrides can be given to <code>shakeOptions</code> by separating them with a comma, for example <code>shakeOptions{shakeFiles=&quot;_build/&quot;,shakeThreads=8}</code>.</p><h4>Progress prediction</h4><p>One useful feature of Shake is that it can predict the remaining build time, based on how long previous builds have taken. The number is only a prediction, but it does take account of which files require rebuilding, how fast your machine is currently running, parallelism settings etc. You can display progress messages in the titlebar of a Window by either:</p><ul><li>Running <code>build --progress</code></li><li>Setting <code>shakeOptions{shakeProgress=progressSimple}</code></li></ul><p>The progress message will be displayed in the titlebar of the window, for example <code>3m12s (82%)</code> to indicate that the build is 82% complete and is predicted to take a further 3 minutes and 12 seconds. If you are running Windows 7 or higher and place the <a href="http://github.org/ndmitchell/shake"><code>shake-progress</code></a> utility somewhere on your <code>%PATH%</code> then the progress will also be displayed in the taskbar progress indicator:</p><p><img src="shake-progress.png" alt></p><p>Progress prediction is likely to be relatively poor during the first build and after running <code>build clean</code>, as then Shake has no information about the predicted execution time for each rule. To rebuild from scratch without running clean (because you really want to see the progress bar!) you can use the argument <code>--always-make</code>, which assumes all rules need rerunning. </p><h4>Lint</h4><p>Shake features a built in &quot;lint&quot; features to check the build system is well formed. To run <code>build --lint</code>. You are likely to catch more lint violations if you first <code>build clean</code>. Sadly, lint does <i>not</i> catch missing dependencies. However, it does catch:</p><ul><li>The current directory does not change. You should never change the current directory within the build system as multiple rules running at the same time will share the current directory. You can still run <code>cmd</code> calls in different directories using the <code>Cwd</code> argument.</li><li>Dependencies are not modified after they are depended upon. The common reason for violating this check is that you one rule writing to a file which has a different rule associated with it.</li></ul><p>There is a performance penalty for building with <code>--lint</code>, but it is typically small.</p><h4>Profiling</h4><p>Shake features an advanced profiling feature. To build with profiling run <code>build --report</code>, which will generate an interactive HTML profile named <code>report.html</code>. This report lets you examine what happened in that run, what takes most time to run, what rules depend on what etc. There is a help page included in the profiling output, and a <a href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/ndmitchell/shake/35fbe03c8d3bafeae17b58af89497ff3fdd54b22/html/demo.html">profiling tutorial/demo</a>.</p><p>To view profiling information for the <i>previous</i> build, you can run <code>build --no-build --report</code>. This feature is useful if you have a build execution where a file unexpectedly rebuilds, you can generate a profiling report afterwards and see why. To generate a lightweight report (about 5 lines) printed to the console run <code>build --report=-</code>. </p><h4>Tracing and debugging</h4><p>To debug a build system there are a variety of techniques that can be used:</p><ul><li>Run with lint checking enabled (<code>--lint</code>), which may spot and describe the problem for you.</li><li>Run in single-threaded mode (<code>-j1</code>) to make any output clearer by not interleaving commands.</li><li>By default a Shake build system prints out a message every time it runs a command. Use verbose mode (<code>--verbose</code>) to print more information to the screen, such as which rule is being run. Additional <code>--verbose</code> flags increase the verbosity. Three verbosity flags produce output intended for someone debugging the Shake library itself, rather than a build system based on it.</li><li>To raise a build error call <code>error &quot;error message&quot;</code>. Shake will abort, showing the error message.</li><li>To output additional information use <code>putNormal &quot;output message&quot;</code>. This message will be printed to the console when it is reached.</li><li>To show additional information with either <code>error</code> or <code>putNormal</code>, use <code>error $ show (&quot;message&quot;, myVariable)</code>. This allows you to show any local variables.</li></ul><h2>Extensions</h2><p>This section details a number of build system features that are useful in some build systems, but not the initial example, and not most average build systems.</p><h4>Advanced <code>cmd</code> usage</h4><p>The <code>cmd</code> function can also obtain the stdout and stderr streams, along with the  exit code. As an example:</p><pre><code>(Exit code, Stdout out, Stderr err) &lt;- cmd &quot;gcc --version&quot;</code></pre><p>Now the variable <code>code</code> is bound to the exit code, while <code>out</code> and <code>err</code> are bound to the stdout and stderr streams. If <code>ExitCode</code> is not requested then any non-zero return value will raise an error.</p><p>The <code>cmd</code> function also takes additional parameters to control how the command is run. As an example:</p><pre><code>cmd Shell (Cwd &quot;temp&quot;) &quot;pwd&quot;</code></pre><p>This runs the <code>pwd</code> command through the system shell, after first changing to the <code>temp</code> directory.</p><h4>Dependencies on environment variables</h4><p>You can use tracked dependencies on environment variables using the <code>getEnv</code> function. As an example:</p><pre><code>link &lt;- getEnv &quot;C_LINK_FLAGS&quot;
let linkFlags = fromMaybe &quot;&quot; link    
cmd &quot;gcc -o&quot; [output] inputs linkFlags</code></pre><p>This example gets the <code>$C_LINK_FLAGS</code> environment variable (which is <code>Maybe String</code>, namely a <code>String</code> that might be missing), then using <code>fromMaybe</code> defines a local variable <code>linkFlags</code> that is the empty string when <code>$C_LINK_FLAGS</code> is not set. It then passes these flags to <code>gcc</code>.</p><p>If the <code>$C_LINK_FLAGS</code> environment variable changes then this rule will rebuild.</p><h4>Dependencies on extra information</h4><p>Using Shake we can depend on arbitrary extra information, such as the version of <code>gcc</code>, allowing us to automatically rebuild all C files when a different compiler is placed on the path. To track the version, we can define a rule for the file <code>gcc.version</code> which changes only when <code>gcc --version</code> changes:</p><pre><code>&quot;gcc.version&quot; *&gt; \out -&gt; do
    alwaysRerun
    Stdout stdout &lt;- cmd &quot;gcc --version&quot;
    writeFileChanged out stdout</code></pre><p>This rule has the action <code>alwaysRerun</code> meaning it will be run in every execution that requires it, so the <code>gcc --version</code> is always checked. This rule defines no dependencies (no <code>need</code> actions), so if it lacked <code>alwaysRerun</code>, this rule would only be run when <code>gcc.version</code> was missing. The function then runs <code>gcc --version</code> storing the output in <code>stdout</code>. Finally, it calls <code>writeFileChanged</code> which writes <code>stdout</code> to <code>out</code>, but only if the contents have changed. The use of <code>writeFileChanged</code> is important otherwise <code>gcc.version</code> would change in every run. To use this rule, we <code>need [&quot;gcc.version&quot;]</code> in every rule that calls <code>gcc</code>.</p><p>Shake also contains a feature called &quot;oracles&quot;, which lets you do the same thing without the use of a file, which is sometimes more convenient. Interested readers should look at the function documentation list for <code>addOracle</code>.</p><h4>Resources</h4><p>Resources allow us to limit the number of simultaneous operations more precisely than just the number of simultaneous jobs (the <code>-j</code> flag). For example, calls to compilers are usually CPU bound but calls to linkers are usually disk bound. Running 8 linkers will often cause an 8 CPU system to grid to a halt. We can limit ourselves to 4 linkers with:</p><pre><code>disk &lt;- newResource &quot;Disk&quot; 4
want [show i &lt;.&gt; &quot;exe&quot; | i &lt;- [1..100]]
&quot;*.exe&quot; *&gt; \out -&gt; do
    withResource disk 1 $ do
        cmd &quot;ld -o&quot; [out] ...
&quot;*.o&quot; *&gt; \out -&gt; do
    cmd &quot;cl -o&quot; [out] ...</code></pre><p>Assuming <code>-j8</code>, this allows up to 8 compilers, but only a maximum of 4 linkers.</p><h4>Multiple outputs</h4><p>Some tools, for example <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/">bison</a>, can generate multiple outputs from one execution. We can track these in Shake using the <code>&amp;*&gt;</code> operator to define rules:</p><pre><code>[&quot;//*.bison.h&quot;,&quot;//*.bison.c&quot;] &amp;*&gt; \[outh, outc] -&gt; do
    let src = outc -&lt;.&gt; &quot;y&quot;
    cmd &quot;bison -d -o&quot; [outc] [src]</code></pre><p>Now we define a list of patterns that are matched, and get a list of output files. If any output file is required, then all output files will be built, with proper dependencies.</p><h4>Changing build rules</h4><p>Shake build systems are set up to rebuild files when the dependencies change, but mostly assume that the build rules themselves do not change. To minimise the impact of build rule changes there are three approaches:</p><p><i>Use configuration files:</i> Most build information, such as which files a C file includes, can be computed from source files. Where such information is not available, such as which C files should be linked together to form an executable, use configuration files to provide the information. The rule for linking can use these configuration files, which can be properly tracked. Moving any regularly changing configuration into separate files will significantly reduce the number of build system changes.</p><p><i>Depend on the build source:</i> One approach is to depend on the build system source in each of the rules, then if <i>any</i> rules change, <i>everything</i> will rebuild. While this option is safe, it may cause a significant number of redundant rebuilds. As a restricted version of this technique, for a generated file you can include a dependency on the generator source and use <code>writeFileChanged</code>. If the generator changes it will rerun, but typically only a few generated files will change, so little is rebuilt.</p><p><i>Use a version stamp:</i> There is a field named <code>shakeVersion</code> in the <code>ShakeOptions</code> record. If the build system changes in a significant and incompatible way, you can change this field to force a full rebuild. If you want all rules to depend on all rules, you can put a hash of the build system source in the version field, as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18532552/shake-how-to-reliably-automatically-force-rebuild-when-my-rules-change-becomi/18532553#18532553">described here</a>.</p><h2>The Haskell Zone</h2><p>From now on, this manual assumes some moderate knowledge of Haskell. Most of the things in this section are either impossible to do with other build systems or can be faked by shell script. None of the Haskell is particularly advanced.</p><h4>Haskell Expressions</h4><p>You can use any Haskell function at any point. For example, to only link files without numbers in them, we can <code>import Data.Char</code> and then write:</p><pre><code>let os = [&quot;_build&quot; &lt;/&gt; c -&lt;.&gt; &quot;o&quot; | c &lt;- inputs, not $ any isDigit c]</code></pre><p>For defining non-overlapping rules it is sometimes useful to use a more advanced predicate. For example, to define a rule that only builds results which have a numeric extension, we can use the <code>?&gt;</code> rule definition function:</p><pre><code>(\x -&gt; all isDigit $ drop 1 $ takeExtension x) ?&gt; \out -&gt; do
    ...</code></pre><p>We first get the extension with <code>takeExtension</code>, then use <code>drop 1</code> to remove the leading <code>.</code> that <code>takeExtension</code> includes, then test that all the characters are numeric.</p><p>The standard <code>*&gt;</code> operator is actually defined as:</p><pre><code>pattern *&gt; actions = (pattern ?==) ?&gt; actions</code></pre><p>Where <code>?==</code> is a function for matching file patterns. </p><h4>Haskell Actions</h4><p>You can run any Haskell <code>IO</code> action by using <code>liftIO</code>. As an example:</p><pre><code>liftIO $ launchMissiles True</code></pre><p>Most common IO operations to run as actions are already wrapped and available in the Shake library, including <code>readFile'</code>, <code>writeFile'</code> and <code>copyFile'</code>. Other useful functions can be found in <code>System.Directory</code>.</p><h4>Include files with Visual Studio</h4><p>While <code>gcc</code> has the <code>-MMD</code> flag to generate a Makefile, the Visual Studio compiler <code>cl</code> does not. However, it does have a flag <code>-showincludes</code> which writes the include files on stdout as they are used. The initial example could be written using <code>cl</code> as:</p><pre><code>Stdout stdout &lt;- cmd &quot;cl -showincludes -c&quot; [input] [&quot;-Fo&quot; ++ output]
need [ dropWhile isSpace x
     | x &lt;- lines stdout
     , Just x &lt;- [stripPrefix &quot;Note: including file:&quot; x]]</code></pre><p>The <code>stripPrefix</code> function is available in the <code>Data.List</code> module. One warning: the &quot;including file&quot; message is localised, so if your developers are using non-English versions of Visual Studio the prefix string will be different</p><h4>Generated imports</h4><p>The initial example compiles the C file, then calls <code>need</code> on all its source and header files. This works fine if the header files are all source code. However, if any of the header files are <i>generated</i> by the build system then when the compilation occurs they will not yet have been built. In general it is important to <code>need</code> any generated files <i>before</i> they are used.</p><p>To detect the included headers without using the compiler we can define <code>usedHeaders</code> as a top-level function:</p><pre><code>usedHeaders src = [init x | x &lt;- lines src, Just x &lt;- [stripPrefix &quot;#include \&quot;&quot; x]]</code></pre><p>This function takes the source code of a C file (<code>src</code>) and finds all lines that begin <code>#include &quot;</code>, then takes the filename afterwards. This function does not work for all C files, but for most projects it is usually easy to write such a function that covers everything allowed by your coding standards.</p><p>Assuming all interesting headers are only included directly by the C file (a restriction we remove in the next section), we can write the build rule as:</p><pre><code>&quot;_build//*.o&quot; *&gt; \out -&gt; do
    let c = dropDirectory1 $ out -&lt;.&gt; &quot;c&quot;
    src &lt;- readFile' c
    need $ usedHeaders src
    cmd &quot;gcc -c&quot; [c] &quot;-o&quot; [out]</code></pre><p>This code calls <code>readFile'</code> (which automatically calls <code>need</code> on the source file), then uses calls <code>need</code> on all headers used by the source file, then calls <code>gcc</code>. All files have <code>need</code> called on them before they are used, so if the C file or any of the header files have build system rules they will be run. </p><h4>Generated transitive imports</h4><p>The previous section described how to deal with generated include files, but only coped with headers included directly by the C file. This section describes how to extend that to work with generated headers used either in C or header files, even when used by headers that were themselves generated. We can write:</p><pre><code>[&quot;*.c.dep&quot;,&quot;*.h.dep&quot;] |*&gt; \out -&gt; do
    src &lt;- readFile' $ dropExtension out
    writeFileLines out $ usedHeaders src

&quot;*.deps&quot; *&gt; \out -&gt; do
    dep &lt;- readFileLines $ out -&lt;.&gt; &quot;dep&quot;
    deps &lt;- mapM (readFileLines . (&lt;.&gt; &quot;deps&quot;)) dep
    writeFileLines out $ nub $ dropExtension out : concat deps

&quot;*.o&quot; *&gt; \out -&gt; do
    deps &lt;- readFileLines $ out -&lt;.&gt; &quot;c.deps&quot;
    need deps
    cmd &quot;gcc -c&quot; [dropExtension out] &quot;-o&quot; out</code></pre><p>For simplicity, this code assumes all files are in a single directory and all objects are generated files are placed in the same directory. We define three rules:</p><ul><li>The <code>*.c.dep</code> and <code>*.h.dep</code> rule uses <code>|*&gt;</code>, which defines a single action that matches multiple patterns. The file <code>foo.h.dep</code> contains a list of headers directly included by <code>foo.h</code>, using <code>usedHeaders</code> from the previous section.</li><li>The <code>*.deps</code> rule takes the transitive closure of dependencies, so <code>foo.h.deps</code> contains <code>foo.h</code> and all headers that <code>foo.h</code> pulls in. The rule takes the target file, and all the <code>.deps</code> for anything in the <code>.dep</code> file, and combines them. More abstractly, the rule calculates the transitive closure of <i>a</i>, namely <i>a*</i>, by taking the dependencies of <i>a</i> (say <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>) and computing <i>a* = union(a, b*, c*)</i>.</li><li>The <code>*.o</code> rule reads the associated <code>.deps</code> file (ensuring it is up to date) and then depends on its contents.</li></ul><p>The pattern of <code>*.deps</code> files occurs frequently, for example when linking Haskell files.</p></pre>
