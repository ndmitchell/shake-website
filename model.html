To be a little more concrete, let's talk about <code>File</code>s which are stored on disk, which have <code>ModTime</code> value's associated with them, where <code>modtime</code> gives the <code>ModTime</code> of a <code>FilePath</code> (Shake is actually generalised over all those things). Let's also imagine we have the rule:</p><pre>file <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake/docs/Development-Shake.html#v:-37--62-">%&gt;</a> <span class="sym">\</span>out <span class="sym">-&gt;</span> <span class="key">do</span>
    <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake/docs/Development-Shake.html#v:need">need</a> <span class="sym">[</span>dependency<span class="sym">]</span>
    run</code></pre><p>So <code>file</code> depends on <code>dependency</code> and rebuilds by executing the action <code>run</code>.</p><span class="target" id="the-make-model"></span><h2><a href="#the-make-model" class="anchor">The Make Model</a></h2><p>In Make there is no additional state, only the file-system. A file is considered dirty if it has a dependency such that:</p><pre>modtime dependency &gt; modtime file</code></pre><p>As a consequence, <code>run</code> <i>must</i> update <code>modtime file</code>, or the file will remain dirty and rebuild in subsequent runs.</p><span class="target" id="the-shake-model"></span><h2><a href="#the-shake-model" class="anchor">The Shake Model</a></h2><p>For Shake, the state is:</p><pre>database <span class="sym">::</span> File <span class="sym">-&gt;</span> <span class="sym">(</span>ModTime, <span class="sym">[</span><span class="sym">(</span>File, ModTime<span class="sym">)</span><span class="sym">]</span><span class="sym">)</span></code></pre><p>Each <code>File</code> is associated with a pair containing the <code>ModTime</code> of that file, plus a list of each dependency and their <code>modtime</code>s, all from when the rule was last run. As part of executing the rule above, Shake records the association:</p><pre>file <span class="sym">-&gt;</span> <span class="sym">(</span>modtime file, <span class="sym">[</span><span class="sym">(</span>dependency, modtime dependency<span class="sym">)</span><span class="sym">]</span><span class="sym">)</span></code></pre><p>The <code>file</code> is considered dirty if any of the information is no longer current. In this example, if either <code>modtime file</code> changes, or <code>modtime dependency</code> changes.</p><p>There are a few consequences of the Shake model:</p><ul><li>There is no requirement for <code>modtime file</code> to change as a result of <code>run</code>. The file is dirty because something changed, after we run the rule and record new information it becomes clean.</li><li>Since a file is not required to change its <code>modtime</code>, things that depend on <code>file</code> may not require rebuilding even if <code>file</code> rebuilds.</li><li>If you update an output file, it will rebuild that file, as the <code>ModTime</code> of a result is tracked.</li><li>Shake only ever performs equality tests on <code>ModTime</code>, never ordering, which means it generalises to other types of value and works even if your file-system sometimes has incorrect times.</li></ul><p>These consequences allow two workflows that aren't pleasant in Make:</p><ul><li>Generated files, where the generator changes often, but the output of the generator for a given input changes rarely. In Shake, you can rerun the generator regularly, and using a function that writes only on change (<code><a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake/docs/Development-Shake.html#v:writeFileChanged">writeFileChanged</a></code> in Shake) you don't rebuild further. This technique can reduce some rebuilds from hours to seconds.</li><li>Configuration file splitting, where you have a configuration file with lots of key/value pairs, and want certain rules to only depend on a subset of the keys. In Shake, you can generate a file for each key/value and depend only on that key. If the configuration file updates, but only a subset of keys change, then only a subset of rules will rebuild. Alternatively, using <code><a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake/docs/Development-Shake-Config.html">Development.Shake.Config</a></code> you can avoid the file for each key, but the dependency model is the same.</li></ul><span class="target" id="optimising-the-model"></span><h2><a href="#optimising-the-model" class="anchor">Optimising the Model</a></h2><p>The above model expresses the semantics of Shake, but the implementation uses an optimised model. Note that the original <a href="http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/downloads/paper-shake_before_building-10_sep_2012.pdf">Shake paper</a> gives the optimised model, not the easy to understand model - that's because I only figured out the difference a few days ago (thanks to Simon Marlow, Simon Peyton Jones and Andrey Mokhov). To recap, we started with:</p><pre>database <span class="sym">::</span> File <span class="sym">-&gt;</span> <span class="sym">(</span>ModTime, <span class="sym">[</span><span class="sym">(</span>File, ModTime<span class="sym">)</span><span class="sym">]</span><span class="sym">)</span></code></pre><p>We said that <code>File</code> is dirty if any of the <code>ModTime</code> values change. That's true, but what we are really doing is comparing the first <code>ModTime</code> with the <code>ModTime</code> <i>on disk</i>, and the list of second <code>ModTime</code>'s with those <i>in <code>database</code></i>. Assuming we are passed the current <code>ModTime</code> on disk, then a file is valid if:</p><pre>valid <span class="sym">::</span> File <span class="sym">-&gt;</span> ModTime <span class="sym">-&gt;</span> Bool
valid file mNow <span class="sym">=</span>
    mNow <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake/docs/Development-Shake-Classes.html#v:-61--61-">==</a> mOld &amp;&amp;
    and <span class="sym">[</span>fst <span class="sym">(</span>database d<span class="sym">)</span> <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake/docs/Development-Shake-Classes.html#v:-61--61-">==</a> m <span class="sym">|</span> <span class="sym">(</span>d,m<span class="sym">)</span> <span class="sym">&lt;-</span> deps<span class="sym">]</span>
    where <span class="sym">(</span>mOld, deps<span class="sym">)</span> <span class="sym">=</span> database file</code></pre><p>The problem with this model is that we store each <code>File</code>/<code>ModTime</code> pair once for the file itself, plus once for every dependency. That's a fairly large amount of information, and in Shake both <code>File</code> and <code>ModTime</code> can be arbitrarily large for user rules.</p><p>Let's introduce two assumptions:</p><p><i>Assumption 1:</i> A <code>File</code> only has at most one <code>ModTime</code> per Shake run, since a file will only rebuild at most once per run. We use <code>Step</code> for the number of times Shake has run on this project.</p><p><i>Consequence 1:</i> The <code>ModTime</code> for a file and the <code>ModTime</code> for its dependencies are all recorded in the same run, so they share the same <code>Step</code>.</p><p><i>Assumption 2:</i> We assume that if the <code>ModTime</code> of a <code>File</code> changes, and then changes back to a previous value, we can still treat that as dirty. In the specific case of <code>ModTime</code> that would require time travel, but even for other values it is very rare.</p><p><i>Consequence 2:</i> We only use historical <code>ModTime</code> values to compare them for equality with current <code>ModTime</code> values. We can instead record the <code>Step</code> at which the <code>ModTime</code> last changed, assuming all older <code>Step</code> values are unequal.</p><p>The result is:</p><pre>database <span class="sym">::</span> File <span class="sym">-&gt;</span> <span class="sym">(</span>ModTime, Step, Step, <span class="sym">[</span>File<span class="sym">]</span><span class="sym">)</span>

We now check if the <code>Step</code> for this file is greater than the <code>Step</code> at which <code>dependency</code> last changed. Using the assumptions above, the original formulation is equivalent.</p><p>Note that instead of storing one <code>ModTime</code> per dependency+1, we now store exactly one <code>ModTime</code> plus two small <code>Step</code> values.</p><p>We still store each file many times, but we reduce that by creating a bijection between <code>File</code> (arbitrarily large) and <code>Id</code> (small index) and only storing <code>Id</code>.</p><span class="target" id="implementing-the-model"></span><h2><a href="#implementing-the-model" class="anchor">Implementing the Model</a></h2><p>For those who like concrete details, which might change at any point in the future, the relevant definition is in <a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/shake/blob/master/Development/Shake/Database.hs#L107">Development.Shake.Database</a>:</p><pre>data Result <span class="sym">=</span> Result

dependencies must existing in the graph (lookups never fail) and there
are no cycles.</p><p>The invariant on using the database is that before using any
information, you must ensure it is valid. So before looking up the
dependencies you must ensure they have become valid.</p><p>There are some attempts at defining rules somewhat like yours in the
paper, in S5.1 (see
http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/downloads/paper-shake<i>before</i>building-10<i>sep</i>2012.pdf).
It's certainly an area that needs formalising in order to properly
express the properties.</p><blockquote><p> Suppose the database contains <code>file <span class="sym">-&gt;</span> <span class="sym">(</span>mf, <span class="sym">[</span><span class="sym">(</span>di,mdi<span class="sym">)</span><span class="sym">]</span><span class="sym">)</span></code>
 The file is &quot;clean&quot; if the mod-time on disk of 'file' is 'mf'
 and the mod-time on disk of each dependency 'di' is 'mdi'.</p><p> Or perhaps the latter sentence should say &quot;if each of the
 dependencies 'di' is clean, and fst(lookup(di)) = mdi?</p></blockquote><p>Assuming there are no files being changed by the external world while
Shake is working, and that all dependencies are clean before they are
used, these two things are the same. In practice, Shake uses the
second formulation, but hopefully that's just an implementation
detail.</p><blockquote><p> A file is &quot;dirty&quot; if it is not clean.</p></blockquote><p>Basically, yes. In reality files have a few more states - see Figure 5
in the paper where Ready = clean and Building = dirty. The other
states correspond to files which are in the process of being checked,
and for files that throw exceptions when rebuilding.</p><blockquote><p>When 'file' is rebuilt, Shake updates the database with
<code>file <span class="sym">-&gt;</span> <span class="sym">(</span>modtime file, <span class="sym">[</span><span class="sym">(</span>dependency, modtime dependency<span class="sym">)</span><span class="sym">]</span><span class="sym">)</span></code>
But is &quot;modtime file&quot; read from the disk?  That is, is it an
invariant that, for a clean file, the fst of the tuple is the
actual on-disk mod-time?</p></blockquote><p>Yes. While running a rule, Shake records the dependencies in an
environment. At the end of that rule, Shake looks at the ondisk
modification time, and records that along with the environment.</p><blockquote><p>Presumably the list of dependencies may be different than
 the previous time.</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, the previous dependencies determine whether a file is
dirty/clean, but as soon as the rule starts running they are
discarded.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;If you update an output file, it will rebuild that file,
  as the ModTime of a result is tracked&quot;.  I did not understand that.</p></blockquote><p>Given a build system that does:</p><pre><span class="str">&quot;output&quot;</span> <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake/docs/Development-Shake.html#v:-37--62-">%&gt;</a> <span class="sym">\</span>out <span class="sym">-&gt;</span> <span class="key">do</span>

    <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake/docs/Development-Shake.html#v:cmd">cmd</a> <span class="str">&quot;cp input output&quot;</span></code></pre><p>If you run that, and then run &quot;touch output&quot;, the file &quot;output&quot; will
be dirty and a subsequent execution will rebuild it. In Make that
isn't the case, and &quot;output&quot; would still be clean.</p><span class="target" id="questionsanswers-mb"></span><h2><a href="#questionsanswers-mb" class="anchor">Questions/Answers (mb14)</a></h2><blockquote><p>I'm still confused with the Shake model.</p><p>In you rule <code>File -<span class="sym">(</span>ModTime, <span class="sym">[</span><span class="sym">(</span>File, ModTime<span class="sym">)</span><span class="sym">]</span></code>. Is the time stored for a dependency</p><p>1 - the time the dependency has been last used </p><p>2 - the dependency last modification when the dependency has been used?</p><p>For example. Let's say B depends on A and A has been modified yesterday.</p><p>If I'm building B today: scenario (1) would be store </p><p>database B = (Today, [(A, Today)])</p><p>where as scenario (2) would store</p><p>database B = (Today, [(A, Yesterday)])</p><p>My understanding is scenario 2, in that case, ModTime could be easily replaced by a SHA. However, <i>Consequence 1</i></p><p>The ModTime for a file and the ModTime for its dependencies are all recorded in the same run, so they share the same Step</p><p>Let's suppose we are using scenario (1).</p></blockquote><p>In the simple model, the time stored for a dependency is the last modification when the dependency has been used. So the semantics are based on scenario 2.</p><p>In the complex model, I move to scenario 1, but using some fake notion of Step to be the time.</p><p>The key is that I couldn't record only the scenario 2 information in the simple model because I need to know if the time has changed. I solve that in the complex model by storing two Step values, and relying on some assumptions.</p><blockquote><p>Also, <code>valid</code> doesn't seem to be recursive, whereas you would expect an invalid dependency to invalidate all of it's dependees.
Is this assumption wrong or is the recursion is <i>hidden</i> in the code.</p></blockquote><p>For valid, I am assuming that before you call valid on a File, you have already called valid on all its dependencies, and if necessary, built them so they have become valid. I had noted that in an earlier draft of this post, but it got lost in editing :(.</p></div><p id="footer">
