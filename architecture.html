<div id="content"><h1>Architecture</h1>
<p>The theory behind Shake is documented in the <a href="https://ndmitchell.com/#shake_5_may_2019">Build Systems a la Carte paper</a>. The full code is <a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/shake">on GitHub</a>. A high-level architecture diagram is:</p>

<p><b>Data Storage</b></p>
<p>At it's heart, the Shake &quot;database&quot; (not really a database) stores a mapping from keys (<code>k</code>) to values (<code>v</code>). That mapping is stored on disk as a list of <code><span class="sym">(</span>k,v<span class="sym">)</span></code> pairs. When Shake computes a new value for <code>k</code>, it appends it to the end of the file. When Shake starts, it loads the list, keeping only the last value for any given <code>k</code>, and producing a <code>Map k v</code>. On disk, each entry is prefixed by its size, so that if the file is truncated (e.g. machine shutdown), any trailing incomplete data can be discarded.</p>
<p>When operating in memory, Shake uses the data type <code>Map k <span class="sym">(</span>Status v<span class="sym">)</span></code>, with the approximate definitions:</p>
<pre>data Result v <span class="sym">=</span> Result
    <span class="sym">{</span>result <span class="sym">::</span> v -- ^ the result associated with the Key
    ,built <span class="sym">::</span> Step -- ^ when it was actually run
    ,changed <span class="sym">::</span> Step -- ^ when it last changed
    ,depends <span class="sym">::</span> <span class="sym">[</span><span class="sym">[</span>Id<span class="sym">]</span><span class="sym">]</span> -- ^ dependencies <span class="sym">(</span>Id is roughly key<span class="sym">)</span>
    <span class="sym">}</span>

data Status v
    <span class="sym">=</span> Loaded <span class="sym">(</span>Result v<span class="sym">)</span>
    <span class="sym">|</span> Running <span class="sym">(</span>Either SomeException <span class="sym">(</span>Result v<span class="sym">)</span> <span class="sym">-&gt;</span> IO <span class="sym">(</span><span class="sym">)</span><span class="sym">)</span>
    <span class="sym">|</span> Failed SomeException
    <span class="sym">|</span> Ready <span class="sym">(</span>Result v<span class="sym">)</span></code></pre>
<p>Data is loaded in the <code>Loaded</code> state. When someone demands a key it moves to <code>Running</code> - anyone who subsequently demands it will be added to the callback. After the run completes it becomes either <code>Failed</code> or <code>Ready</code>.</p>
<p><b>Execution Model</b></p>
<p>Shake runs values in the <code><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake/docs/Development-Shake.html#t:Action">Action</a></code> monad, which is a combination of some global state (e.g. settings), per-rule state (e.g. dependencies) and continuations, with IO underlying everything. The execution model of Shake is that every <code><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake/docs/Development-Shake.html#t:Action">Action</a></code> computation is either blocked waiting for a <code>Running</code> to complete, or queued/executing with the thread pool. The thread pool has a list of things to do and runs them in a given priority order, respecting parallelism constraints. Most threads start up, do a bit of work, block on a <code>Running</code> and leave it for another item in the thread pool to requeue them.</p>
<p>To pause a thread we use continuations, meaning the most important operation on <code><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake/docs/Development-Shake.html#t:Action">Action</a></code> (which isn't available to users!) is:</p>
<pre>captureRAW <span class="sym">::</span> <span class="sym">(</span><span class="sym">(</span>Either SomeException <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake/docs/Development-Shake.html#t:a">a</a> <span class="sym">-&gt;</span> IO <span class="sym">(</span><span class="sym">)</span><span class="sym">)</span> <span class="sym">-&gt;</span> IO <span class="sym">(</span><span class="sym">)</span><span class="sym">)</span> <span class="sym">-&gt;</span> <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake/docs/Development-Shake.html#t:Action">Action</a> <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake/docs/Development-Shake.html#t:a">a</a></code></pre>
<p>This function stops an <code><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake/docs/Development-Shake.html#t:Action">Action</a></code> in its tracks, resuming it when the continuation is called. One invariant of Shake, which is (sadly!) not tracked by the type system is that every continuation passed to <code>captureRAW</code> must be called exactly once.</p>
<p>The symmetry between <code>Running</code> and <code>captureRAW</code> is deliberate, and convenient.</p>
<p>To kick start the thread pool, the user specifies things to run with <code><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake/docs/Development-Shake.html#v:action">action</a></code> - a Shake program completes when all those initial <code><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake/docs/Development-Shake.html#v:action">action</a></code> calls have completed.</p>
<p><b>Rules</b></p>
<p>The final piece of the puzzle is what Shake actually <i>does</i> to build a key. The core of Shake is abstract over the <code>k</code> and <code>v</code>, but Shake ships with an outer layer of around ten additional rule types &ndash; the most important of which is files. Taking an idealised (and inefficient) file rule, we can think of it as mapping from file paths to file contents. To provide such a rule, we first declare the type mapping:</p>
<pre>type instance RuleResult <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake/docs/Development-Shake-FilePath.html#t:FilePath">FilePath</a> <span class="sym">=</span> String</code></pre>
<p>And then declare the rule. The rule says how to take the key (the filename), whether its dependencies have changed, the old value (the old contents), and produce a new value (the current contents). In addition, the rule must say if the contents have changed in a meaningful way, which causes anyone who depended on them to rebuild.</p>
<p>Shake programs typically call <code><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake/docs/Development-Shake-Rule.html#v:apply">apply</a></code> which builds a list of keys in parallel, moving all the keys to <code>Loaded</code> (or at least one to <code>Failed</code>) before continuing.</p>
